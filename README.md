# tabletopserver
A flask based web server running various table top helpers. Currently included:

* Raiders of the North Sea setup shuffler. Allows the user to select which expansions are in play. The code shuffles the tokens and displays the setup as a grid.
* Just One word generator. Randomizes a Finnish noun. The Sqlite database (corpus.db) has been formed using wiktionary database dump.

More will be added when/if I find some table top game challenging. Potential helpers might be e.g. scoring calculators. Feel free to suggest a tool that you would find helpful.
